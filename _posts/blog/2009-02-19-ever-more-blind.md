For the last few days my eyes have been feeling strained and I've had a
constant low-level headache. I'm usually pretty good at knowing what is wrong,
and I was sure that my prescription was off.

I wasn't wrong. Although the optometrist said that the relatively sudden onset
of headaches was probably the result of working too hard (most of my few
readers are probably laughing now).

Basically, I am more myoptic (short sighted, represented by SPH), but my
astigmatism (none spherical-ness of the eye, CYL) is the same. Oddly, the ways
my eyes are pointing (Axis) has reversed… either that or someone wrote them
down the wrong way around!

To cut a boring story off quickly, I ended up shelling out £309 for a new pair
of frames and lenses! My current frames have last for about 5 years (with 3
prescription changes), so hopefully it will be money well spent.
