I recently got one of these household electricity display devices things and
being the information fiend that I am I've started studiously recording how
much electricity I use. That lead to the obvious question, How much is normal
electricity consumption in the UK. The Internet did not provide me with
reliable and consistent answer to this question, so after not inconsiderable
rooting for information, I derived the answer from the most up to date
available:

**1&thinsp;860&nbsp;kWh** (per person per year, UK, 2007). I'll write about how
my consumption compares once I have more lovely data to play with.

That is based on data from [The Department of Business Innovation and
Skills](http://www.berr.gov.uk/) on the UK domestic electricity consumption in
2007 (117 126.2 GWh) and the associated number of domestic meters
(26 670.3×10<sup>3</sup>) <sup>1</sup>. For the per person figure, the
UK 2001 Census provides a persons per household figure of 2.36
<sup>2</sup>.
