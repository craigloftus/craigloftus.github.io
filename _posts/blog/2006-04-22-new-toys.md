Over the Easter holiday I managed to find some time to tinker with a few new
features for my website.

Statistics
----------

This grew out of my insatiable curiosity which has meant I have sought to
record visitors to my website for some time now. I forced myself around to
doing so, managing to get it started by combining it with a new fascination for
Google Maps. There are quite a few features I would like to try to work into
it, but I think the basics are there. You are being watched! (But only if you
visit the index page).

Polyliner
---------

A tool for drawing routes onto Google Maps, and associating information with
it. This is very much in development at the moment, and there are lot of things
Iâ€™m not particularly happy with. This came from a need to display migration
routes of my ancestors to be place on the family website my dad was is
developing.

*Update* These are no longer available
