I live surrounded by information I have carefully chosen to be compatible with
my own beliefs and understanding – I live in an Information Cocoon and without
meaning to be rude, I suspect you do too! It is something that is difficult to
avoid, we have limits on our information gathering capacity in both time and
money so why shouldn't we spend our time reading only what interests us and the
authors/sources we tend to agree with or trust? The danger (and I don’t use the
word lightly) is that we close ourselves off from conflicting opinions and
facts presented by other sources. By only consuming mutually affirmative
sources we increase the intensity of our beliefs/understanding and further skew
the range of issues and topics we’re familiar with.

I have tacitly realised this on several occasions but have usually shrugged my
shoulders and accepted it. Today I've decided to make steps to rectify the
situation. I'm going to add the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/home/uk)
and [The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/dailymail/home.html)
to my feeds (I might have to change the latter as I'm not sure I'll be able to
survive reading it for long!). This is a paltry step really… but what else can
I do? Perhaps I should try befriending a Tory voter?
