The following is a copy of the letter I sent to my MP ([Nicola Blackwood, CON,
Oxford West and
Abingdon](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/nicola_blackwood/oxford_west_and_abingdon))
regarding the comments in parliament made by Theresa May with regard to the
[anti-cuts protests in
London](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2011_anti-cuts_protest_in_London)
on 2011-03-26.

	Dear Nicola Blackwood,

	Of the ~200 [1] thugs Theresa May stated had been arrested during and after the
	recent protests in London, 138 [2] were the "mindless thug[s]" [3] involved in
	occupying Fortnum & Mason.

	I direct your attention to a video (published by the Guardian) taken by 'legal
	observers' within the Fortnum & Mason store [4]. The video shows a police chief
	inspector calmly telling the protesters that they: are free to go, will be
	safely escorted from the building, and had not been involved in violent
	thuggery. So, Theresa May made a political statement which contradicted the
	legal opinion of a police chief inspector (or the inspector was lying when
	addressing the public); either is distressing.

	In all likelihood the charges against the individuals arrested will be minor or
	will be dropped entirely; However, it is a concern if a trumped up charge for a
	public order offence could in future results in having you banned from
	attending protests.

	In the mean time the figures are being used to fuel a cross party zeal for
	authoritarian measures. I would like your assurances that you will act to
	ensure that stereotyping and knee jerk reactions do not drive policy. You seem
	to be a keen question writer and I'm generally happy with the tone you've taken
	on the Protection of Freedoms Bill; perhaps you’d consider a question to the
	home secretary on this issue?

	(I have no involvement with UK Uncut or know anyone personally effected
	by the events in question; I’m simply concerned by the tone taken by
	MPs on this issue)

	Yours sincerely,
	Craig Loftus
