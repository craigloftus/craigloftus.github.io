In the papers and articles I read in the information management realm there
seems to be a great love of stating the obvious. I would like to share some
examples which have had me giggling at my desk this morning:

    [The] importance [of plan implementation] cannot be overstated, as without
    plan implementation the planning exercise may be thrown into question.

    Planning outcomes have typically been operationalised as the extent to
    which key planning objectives have been fulfilled.

The last quote had three references! Perhaps I do not yet understand the
principles of writing quality papers but I really do not understand the need
for such trivial statements? In some ways I actually admire the author’s
ability to express fundamental truths so carefully – and so seriously.
