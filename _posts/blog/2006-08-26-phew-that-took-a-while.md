I've been working for quite a while on the launch of a new website for
PhotoSoc.

This is the largest site I've ever attempted and hopefully it won't all come
crashing down around my ears. The site consists of a single framework
integrating a calendar (based on a heavily hacked WebCalendar), forum (using
PunBB) and a custom built photo gallery. Working with WebCalendar has been a
painful process, it is a very poorly written and required substantial hacking.
PunBB on the other hand has been almost trouble free, the website user system
is based on the PunBB database and despite this the only customisation I've
done has been entirely superficial.

Although as it stands the site is not complete or fully polished, I've just
come across some real work so some features I was hoping to implement are going
to have to wait, or just be forgotten.
