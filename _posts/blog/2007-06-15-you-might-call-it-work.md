Well then, I've finished my degree. I was awarded a 2:1 for my masters in
Aerospace engineering, which I'm pretty pleased with. I've now accepted an
offer to undertake a PhD at Bath in Information in Engineering Design.

By 'Information' I mean pretty much all the data/knowledge bound up within the
processes that go into producing a real live piece of engineering. One of the
ideas that has been floated in my direction centres on “Information push”. This
is trying to provide people with the information they need before they realise
that they do.

Related to all of this I've been lucky enough to be able to start a project to
map the skills within a large engineering company. I've been told not to
broadcast this, so I won't mention names here. There is potential that this
might lead into a sponsored PhD which might mean the direction following the
wishes of the company but (besides the extra money) there would be huge
advantages to having a 'real' aim for the project and someone with a vested
interested in my work.

I came across a Dilbert cartoon strip the other day which struck a rather nice
chord given some of the responses I get when I become a little too enthused
about my chosen subject:
