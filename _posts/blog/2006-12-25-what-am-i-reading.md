I've always enjoyed sharing what I've enjoyed reading, of my friends most if
not all have probably fallen foul of this tendency of mine through being
offered books or having a newspaper shoved under their noses. Why am I going
into all of this now? Well, for some time Iâ€™ve been sharing items using
[Google's feed reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) and it only just occurred
to me that there isn't really any sense in doing it unless I'm going to tell
people about it!? So here is [my collection of shared
articles](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/02291823998085059755).

I'll probably try to work it directly into this blog (or somewhere else on the
website) at some point, but that will have to wait for a little while.

Oh, and a Merry Christmas to the Christians out there.
