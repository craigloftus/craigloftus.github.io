I haven't been able to devote very much, if any time to my website for the last
few months; the pressures of exams have kept me well and truely under the
thumb. I do, however, hope to make some progress in restoring things to their
proper form within the next two days… fingers crossed that things will go
smoothly and that the requiste energy shall bubble forth, consuming me, and
pursuing these weary fingers into action.

To come:

* A proper index with links, snippets of buried content…
* Application of my old blog theme, and its further improvement
* Try to get my google indexing/sitemapping sorted so that people can have a
chance of finding me.
