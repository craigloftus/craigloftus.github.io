I have finally moved away from my previous website host,
[Servelocity](http://servelocity.net/). For too long I have been putting up
with a very old and peculiar setup which has curtailed my fun to a great
extent. Servelocity (and many others) seem positively backwards in their
insistence on hanging on to legacy stable software.

I've been developing another section for my website, but I've been using XML
processing features not available in PHP 4. Now that I've shifted to a more
modern host and the holidays have come along I can finish off the section and
add it to my website :) . It is something that I have been developing with help
from some researchers at The [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) and
hopefully will eventually be published on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/).

During the switch I've also taken the chance to change to a much cheaper (and
less flexible) hosting package. This unfortunately means that I have had to say
goodbye to a lot of content which I was hosting for various people. Although I
say 'unfortunate' I am actually rather glad to be rid of them, as I no longer
have to worry unduly about breaking my website on a whim.
