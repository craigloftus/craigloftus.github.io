The following is a copy of the letter I sent to my MP ([Nicola Blackwood, CON,
Oxford West and
Abingdon](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/nicola_blackwood/oxford_west_and_abingdon))
regarding the proposal for a UK version of the US DMCA take-down notices.

	Dear Nicola Blackwood,

	Ed Vaizey, MP Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries
	recently wrote in reply to a letter from the Open Rights Group [2]:

		Jeremy and I met with key players from the digital economy on 23 February to
		discuss developing new ways for people to access content online. Coming out of
		this meeting was a proposal for a Working Group to be formed to look at
		industry self-regulatory measures to tackle online copyright infringement
		through site-blocking.

	I recognise that it is very important that consumer Interests are considered
	very carefully, and we will be inviting consumer representative groups to
	participate in future discussions on the issue.

	As a self confessed civil libertarian [2] I'm sure you react as badly
	as I do to extra-legal authoritarian solutions such as the site-blocking that
	Vaizey clearly supports. I urge you to voice dissatisfaction with such a
	proposal, and question the overly narrow remit of the Working Group.

	"Industry self-regulatory" measures such as the US DMCA support for take-down
	notices are prone to abuse by aggressive rights-holders; particularly with
	regard to social media sites such as Youtube. It should be clear to anyone why
	they are popular with large corporate rights holders and unpopular with
	(legally) creative individuals.

	Yours sincerely,
	Craig Loftus
