I put a contact form up for my website, so that folk can get in touch with me.
Instead, the sort of people I don't want to be associated with, started trying
to use my form to send mass e-mails, and spam etcâ€¦ as a result I had to take my
form down for a little while, but it is now back up, with an extra layer of
'checks' added in.
