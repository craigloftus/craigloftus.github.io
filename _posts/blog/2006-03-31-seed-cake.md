In an effort to shrug off some of the stresses of my current design project I
decided to track down a recipe for a cake I’d had before at my Grans.

The cake is very sweet, and it will certainly pile the pounds on… using less
sugar would probably be wise, I have included the original amount for the sake
of integrity.

Ingredients:
------------

* 1/2&nbsp;lb butter
* 13&nbsp;oz caster sugar
* 5 eggs
* 1/2&thinsp;lb sifted plain flour
* Pinch of salt
* 3&nbsp;tsp caraway seeds
* Oven: 160°C (G.M. 3).
* Tin: 2&nbsp;lb loaf tin, lined, greased and floured.

Method:
-------

1. Cream the butter
2. Add sugar gradually, beating until light and soft
3. Add eggs one at a time, beating throughly between each one
4. Fold in flour and salt
5. Fold in the caraway seeds
6. Put mixture into the tin, then smooth, and tap
7. Bake for 1½ to 2 hours.

Allow the cake to cool for 30&nbsp;mins afterwards, before turning it out and
placing it on a cooling rack (or if you’re a student like me, use the rack from
your grill pan).

The flavour of the caraway will strengthen if the cake is left for a day or
two.
