This makes a very tasty basic chowder for serving 4-6. You can use a variety of
things as the main ingredient of the dish, this recipe was designed around the
use of a lightly smoked white fish, but a 2nd vegetable can be used, such as
carrot or sweetcorn. The point at which you add the main ingredient will
obviously have to be changed if it has a different cooking time to fish.
