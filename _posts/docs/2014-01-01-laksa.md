Takes me about 20 minutes and serves 2. Serve in big bowls, by itself. This
recipe is a slight modification of that by [Nadine
Abensur](http://www.nadineabensur.com/) in [The Cranks
Bible](http://www.nadineabensur.com/cookery_books/the_cranks_bible.html)
(ISBN:978-1-84188-204-8); which as of writing, is far and away my favourite
recipe book.
