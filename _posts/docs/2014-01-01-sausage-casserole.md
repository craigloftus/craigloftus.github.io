A crude but satisfying sausage casserole. Serves 4 and takes about 70 min.

### Ingredients

* Sausages - × 8 (It doesn't hurt too much to add more!)
* Onion - × 1
* Carrot - × 1
* Tomatoes (tinned) - × 1
* Bulgar wheat - 50&nbsp;g
* Olive oil - 1&nbsp;tbsp
* Garlic - × 2 cloves
* Weak vegetable stock - 570&nbsp;ml
* Herbs (of some sort) - some

### Preparation

* Prepare the onion, garlic as appropriate and chop the carrot into ~0.7&nbsp;cm
  thick half-circles
* If you're using vegetarian sausages (which work nicely in the recipe) then
  you will want to cook the sausages separately, during the first 30&nbsp;min
  simmer (roasting works well for large numbers); once cooked, cut them up into
  chunks

### Instructions

1. Sweat the onions and garlic in the oil
2. Add the carrots, sausages and herbs and fry for 5&nbsp;min
3. Add the tomato, bulgar wheat and stock
4. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 30&nbsp;min
5. Use water to adjust the consistency if necessary
6. Add the sausages
7. Simmer for a further 30&nbsp;min, or until you get hungry/bored
