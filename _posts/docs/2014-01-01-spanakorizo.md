Spanakorizo is Greek for **spinach and rice**, which pretty much sums up this
dish. Apparently the ratio of spinach to rice can be varied greatly, but the
trick is to get the amount of water right. This recipe (with modification) was
recommended by a Greek colleague of Sarah's; he modified an [about.com
recipe](http://greekfood.about.com/od/maindishes/r/spanakorizo2.htm) to more
closely match his mother's.

### Ingredients

* Spinach - 250&nbsp;g
* Onion - ×1, chopped
* Dill - a generous handfull, chopped
* Olive oil - 2&nbsp;tbsp
* Rice - 300&nbsp;g
* Nutmeg - ¼&nbsp;kernel (or some...)
* Water (1) - 2&nbsp;tbsp
* Water (2) - 700&nbsp;ml
* Juice of 1 lemon
* Bouillon - ½&nbsp;tsp

### Instructions

1. Sauté the onion in the oil
2. Add the spinach and 2&nbsp;tbsp of water
3. Whilst waiting for the spinach to wilt grate the nutmeg into the pan
4. Add the rice and the bouillon
5. Add enough water to cook the rice by reduction (or add progressively)
6. Wait for the water to boil then reduce to a simmer until the rice has cooked
7. Season and add the lemon juice
8. Leave to rest for 10&nbsp;in
