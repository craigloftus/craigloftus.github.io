This is my own recipe for refried beans; it should make enough to fill 8
tortillas. We add rice, salsa (or chillies), cheese and yoghurt to make a
complete burrito.

### Ingredients

* Onion - 1 large
* Garlic - 1 clove
* Black beans - 400&nbsp;g (pre-cooked mass)
* Lemon - ½
* Lime - ½
* Coriander leaf (dry) - ½&nbsp;tsp
* Coriander seed - ½&nbsp;tsp
* Cumin - ¼&nbsp;tsp
* Cayenne pepper - ¼&nbsp;tsp
* Salt - ¼&nbsp;tsp
* Black pepper - seasoning

### Preparation

* Chop the onion and slice the garlic
* Juice the lemon and lime
* Drain the beans

### Instructions

1. Fry the onion and garlic until translucent
2. Add the coriander seed and leaf, the cumin and cayenne pepper
3. Quickly fry then add the beans
4. Fry until the beans have heated through and the liquid reduced
5. Add the lemon and lime juice and salt
6. Fry for a further 5&nbsp;min
