A page keeping my notes on making a tasty press coffee.

1. Boil some water
2. Grind 70 g of beans per litre (as coarse and consistent as possible)
3. Use a small amount of water to pre-heat the press and cup
4. Add the grounds to the (emptied) press and pour in water
    * Of course empty the press of the pre-heat water
    * Place the press on scales to accurately measure the water
5. Leave to steep for 4 minutes
6. Break the surface tension with a spoon, so that the coffee cake drops into
solution
7. Scope out the majority of foam and grounds that are still at the top (to
reduce sludge)
8. Press the coffee
9. Pour and drink
